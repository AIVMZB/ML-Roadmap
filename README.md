# ML Roadmap

Here are the following main topics:

[General](General.md)

[Computer Vision](ComputerVision.md)

[Architectures](Architectures.md)

It would be better to spend some time every day learning the topics. Of course some videos are longer than another and some tasks are more complicated, but the main factor is __regularity__.

Feel free to add solved tasks to the repository in Pull Request. 

If you have some questions, the floor is your to ask.
